        "\n",
        "Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from research and technology used to create Google Gemini models. Gemma can be further finetuned to suit specific needs. But Large Language Models, such as Gemma, can be very large in size and some of them may not fit on a sing accelerator for finetuning. In this case there are two general approaches for finetuning them:\n",
        "1. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which seeks to shrink the effective model size by sacrificing some fidelity. LoRA falls in this category and the [Fine-tune Gemma models in Keras using LoRA](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/lora_tuning) tutorial demonstrates how to finetune the Gemma 7B model `gemma_instruct_7b_en` with LoRA using KerasNLP on a single GPU.\n",
        "2. Full parameter finetuning with model parallelism. Model parallelism distributes a single model's weights across multiple devices and enables horizontal scaling. You can find out more about distributed training in this [Keras guide](https://keras.io/guides/distribution/).\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial walks you through using Keras with a JAX backend to finetune the Gemma 7B model with LoRA and model-parallism distributed training on Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Note that LoRA can be turned off in this tutorial for a slower but more accurate full-parameter tuning."

Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\""
